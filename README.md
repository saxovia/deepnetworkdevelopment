# Deep Network Development
## Course Information
### Description
This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth exploration of Deep Learning, particularly focusing on Neural Network architectures. Throughout the semester, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how Deep Neural Networks work, from the fundamental theory behind their design to practical implementation skills. The course primarily covers Supervised Deep Learning techniques and equips students with hands-on experience using PyTorch, a popular Deep Learning framework. By working through exercises and assignments in PyTorch, students will learn to effectively build, train, and optimize neural networks. <br>
<br>
The course also emphasizes ethical considerations in AI development, ensuring that students not only learn the technical aspects of Deep Learning but also understand its broader impact on society.

### Prerequisites
